    <h1>Trying to increase memory retention</h1>

    <h3>The problem with 1 lesson per day</h3>
    <p>The problem with trying to complete one lesson, or one topic per day is retention. 
        Its like trying to learn how to cook the perfect steak in one day. Theres too many topics 
        that you can't just cram in 24 hours like: How to get the perfect crust, how long to let the 
        steak rest for, finishing in the oven, you get my point. The problem gets even worse when trying 
        to learn a more complex topic. Yea sure, It's not too difficult to read all the articles and 
        finish one or two problem sets in one day, but in a weeks time span, how much will you actually retain? 
        I mean even right now as I'm programming this website, I realized I forgot almost all of css, and even flexbox. 
        Which were two very important topics that took awhile to understand and now I have to go back and review.
    </p>

    <h3>The solution</h3> 
    <p>The solution I propose isn't perfect, however I do think it's better than cramming everything into one day. 
        How can I keep on track with completing one topic per day, whilst also spending more than one day on any given topic? 
        By reviewing two topics in a singular day, and completing both in two days. Say for instance I wanna learn topic A but it's 
        pretty complex so I wanna spend more than one day on it, well for half my study time I will study topic A and the other half I'll 
        study topic B. Then the next day I'll finish both problem A and B. This way I get to spend two days on any given topic and at the same time 
        keep the original pace I wanted of completing 1 topic per day. 
    </p>

    <h3>Why is this better?</h3>
    <p>No it might seem as if we only changed two things; study two topics per day, study both topics for two days. However 
        this actually provides three scientific backed upsides. The first benefit being the spacing effect. A meta analysis of 
        184 articles and over 300 experiments, showed that studying in intervals, resulted in the highest retention compared to 
        other common forms of studying such as "cramming". Second reason being retrieval. Revisiting material and having to recall the 
        things you learned have shown to increase retention more than simply rereading or studying a topic one time. The third and final 
        benefit comes from interleaving topics. Evidence shows that studying multiple topics at a time instead of one, transfers to greater 
        long term memory. In case you haven't realized yet my strategy incorporates a little of each of these strategies, by studying multiple 
        topics across multiple days, I get to reap the benefits from interval studying (studying in intervals across 2 days), I have to retrieve 
        information I learned the day prior, and I am studying various topics, all of which increase retention. This is all theoretical as I have 
        not tried it out yet. I'll let you know if it goes well, If it doesn't you'll never know.
